# DSA-Snippets

Collection of small, focused DSA programs and exercises in C — each file demonstrates a single data structure / algorithm implementation (with minimal dependencies).  
This repository is meant as a learning journal: short, well-documented programs you can compile, run, and study.

---

## 📌 About this repo
- Each file is a single, self-contained DSA program (e.g. `Stack1.c`).
- Goal: practice writing classic data-structure/algorithm implementations from scratch and keep a public, incremental record on GitHub.
- Not a production project — educational snippets with clear comments and usage examples.

## How to run
The C code must be first compiled before running, here is how you can do it: <br>
Windows
