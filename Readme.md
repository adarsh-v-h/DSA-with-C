# DSA-Snippets

Collection of small, focused DSA programs and exercises in C — each file demonstrates a single data structure / algorithm implementation (with minimal dependencies).
This repository is meant as a learning journal: short, well-documented programs you can compile, run, and study. <br>
The basic programs are in intermediate stage, now the rest of code related to Doubly Linked List, Trees and Graphs are remanining. I will update those as so as I cover them.

## 📌 About this repo
- Each file is a single, self-contained DSA program (e.g. `Stack1.c`).
- Goal: practice writing classic data-structure/algorithm implementations from scratch and keep a public, incremental record on GitHub.
- Not a production project — educational snippets with clear comments and usage examples.

## How to run
The C code must be first compiled before running, here is how you can do it: <br>
Windows
```bash
gcc -o filename filename.c
filename
```
Linux
```bash
gcc -o filename filename.c
./filename
```

## Before you go
All the programs in here, have bugs, loop holes and can be exploited, but conditions like wrong data input, overflow or underflow conditions. This whole thing is made for jusr understanding, and have a huge space to grow, into better codes.
